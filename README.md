# Interview Preparation: Top Interview 150
Link:  https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/

Welcome to my Interview Preparation Repository! This README outlines my preparation plan using the "Top Interview 150" list from LeetCode. The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills, improve algorithmic thinking, and be well-prepared for technical interviews.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, document solutions, and organize my study plan as I work through the Top Interview 150 problems on LeetCode. This list is curated to include the most frequently asked and important coding problems in interviews for software engineering roles.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

- **Problem List:** A table of all 150 problems with links to their solutions.
- **Solutions:** Detailed solutions to each problem, including code, explanations, and time/space complexity analysis.
- **Notes:** General notes on interview preparation, problem-solving strategies, and key concepts.

## Must-Do List

Hereâ€™s my "Must-Do" list for interview prep:

1. **Daily Problem-Solving:**
   - Dedicate time each day to solving problems from the Top Interview 150 list.
   - Focus on understanding the problem statement, edge cases, and optimizing solutions.

2. **Review Data Structures and Algorithms:**
   - Refresh knowledge on core data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.).
   - Review common algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, recursion, etc.).

3. **Mock Interviews:**
   - Schedule regular mock interviews to practice under time constraints.
   - Focus on clear communication, explaining your thought process, and handling tricky problems.

4. **Analyze Solutions:**
   - After solving a problem, review and analyze the solution.
   - Compare different approaches and optimize for time and space complexity.

5. **Coding Practice:**
   - Practice coding problems in your preferred language.
   - Ensure code is clean, efficient, and follows best practices.

6. **Review and Revise:**
   - Regularly revisit problems to reinforce concepts and techniques.
   - Focus on problems that were initially challenging.

## Problem List

| #  | Problem Name | Difficulty | Link to Solution |
|----|--------------|------------|------------------|
| 1  | Two Sum      | Easy       | [Solution](./solutions/two_sum.md) |
| 2  | Add Two Numbers | Medium | [Solution](./solutions/add_two_numbers.md) |
| ...| ...          | ...        | ...              |

*Note: This table is to be populated as I progress through the problems.*
