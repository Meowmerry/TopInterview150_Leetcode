** Code Pair : ** 
Implement infinite scrolling :

The page will display a list of quotes that come from an API. By default, it shows 10 quotes.

If you scroll down to the bottom of the page, the web application will display a loading indicator. In addition, it’ll call the API to fetch more quotes and append them to the current list.

The URL of the API that you’re going to use is as follows:

https://api.javascripttutorial.net/v1/quotes/?page=1&limit=10
Code language: JavaScript (javascript)
The API accepts two query strings: page and limit. These query strings allow you to paginate the quotes from the server.

The quotes are divided into the pages determined by the page query string. And each page has a number of quotes specified by the limit parameter.
